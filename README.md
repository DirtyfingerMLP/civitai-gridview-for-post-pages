#Civitai Grid View & Layout Fixes

This UserStyle improves the layout of Civitai post pages by replacing the vertical "filmstrip" view with a responsive, maximized grid gallery.

#Features

Grid Layout: Displays images in a 5-column grid (default) instead of a single vertical stack.

Maximized Width: Expands the gallery container to use 80% of the screen width, removing the narrow default constraints.

Smart Responsiveness: Automatically adjusts columns (5 → 4 → 3 → 2) based on your screen size.

Clean UI: Hides sidebar ads and ad-spacers for a cleaner browsing experience. Just for the posts page. Get a real ad-blocker for the rest.
